/**

 * that you know more or less how big the items are you will need to retrieve from a
 * continuous stream of data. And you have plenty of space available, at least enough to
 * store say 20 of these items. The data comes continuous, but in chunks. In that case
 * it is convenient to use this chunkbuffer. You can add chunks of data, and items are
 * constructed out of these chunks.
